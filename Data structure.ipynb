What are data structures and why are they important ?\n","\n"," ▶ Data structures are fundamental to computer science, defining how data is organized, stored and processed in a computer system. They provide a way to efficiently acess, manage and manipulate data, which is crucial for building efficient and effective software applications. Data structures are essential for performance ,readability and scalability of code, as well it solves the promblem at hand.\n","\n"," ▶ Importance of data structure:-\n","\n","* Efficiency:- Data structures are designed to optimize the performance of algorithms and programs.\n","* Readability and maintainbility:-Well structered data makes code easier to understand, debug and maintain.\n","* Promblem solving:- Data structures are essential for solving a wide range of computational promblems.\n","* Foundations for algorithms:-Many algorithms rely on specific data structures to function correctly.\n","* Real world application:- Data structures are used in various real world applications, such as databases, social networks, search engines and operating systems.\n","\n","\n","\n","2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n","\n"," ▶  Mutable data types allow thier values to be modified after creation,while immutable data types cannot be changed once created.\n","\n","Examples for mutable data types\n","\n","1.Lists- lists are ordered collections of items that can be changed.you can add,remove,or modify elements after the list is created.\n","\n","2.Dictionaries-They store data in key-value pairs in key-value pairs,and thier contents can be changed.\n","\n","3.Sets-sets are unordered collections of unique items.elements can be added or removed after the set is created.\n","\n","Examples for immutable data types:\n","\n","1.Strings-They are sequences of characters and cannot be modified after creation.\n","\n","2.Tuples-They are ordered collection of items,but unlike lists,they cannot be modified after creation.\n","\n","3.Numbers(int,float,complex)-Numbers are fundamental data types that cannot be changed once created, as explained in python documentation.\n","\n","3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Lists and tuples are both ordered sequences in python, but they have key differences:\n","\n","Mutability :- lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed (added,remove or modified) after creation. Tuples are immutable; thier elements cannot be changed after creation.\n","\n","Syntax:- Lists are defined using square brackets []. while tuples are defined using parentheses().\n","\n","Use cases:- Lists are suitable for collections that need to be modified, such as a list of tasks or items in a shopping cart. Tuples are suitable for collections that should remain constant, such as coordinates or database records .\n","\n","Performance:- Tuples are generally faster and more memory-efficient than lists due to thier immutability\n","\n","Methods:- Lists have more built-in methods for modifying thier contents (e.g append,insert,remove) while tuples have fewer methods due to thier immutability.\n","\n","4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n","\n"," ▶ Dictionaries are unordered collections of data and are represented with curly brackets { }.Like lists, dictionaries are mutable (mutable) and indexed. With dictionaries, data is stored in a key:value format. Example - mycar is the variable that we have assigned our dictionary.\n","\n","5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Sets and lists sevre different purposes in python, leading to situations where one is more suitable than the other. Sets are particularly useful when:\n","\n","Uniqueness is required:-\n","Sets,by defination,only store unique elements. if the goal is to eliminate duplicates from a collection, converting it to set is an efficient approach.\n","\n","Membership testing is frequent:-\n","Sets are optimized for fast membership testing (checking if element is present). This operation has an average time complexity of O(1) for sets, compared to O(n) is the number of elements. When performing many membership checks, using a set can lead to significant performance improvements.\n","\n","Set operations are needed:- Sets support common mathematical set operations like union, intersection and difference. If these operations are necessary, using sets directly is more convient and efficient than implementing them manually with lists.\n","\n"," ▶ In contrast, lists are more appropriate when:\n","\n","Order matters:-\n","Lists maintain the order of elements, while sets do not gurantee any specific order. If the sequence of elements is important, a list should be used.\n","\n","Duplicates are allowed:-\n","If duplicate elements are acceptable or required, a list is the natural choice.\n","\n","Indexing or slicing is neccesary:-\n","Lists support indexing and slicing, allowing access to elements at specific order. Sets do not provide this functionality.\n","\n"," ▶ For example, consider a scenario where the task is to find the unique words in a large corpus. Using a set would be efficient for this task, as it automatically handles duplicate elimination and provide fast membership testing for checking if a word has already been encountered.\n","\n","6. What is a string in Python and how is it different from a list ?\n","\n"," ▶ A string is a sequence of characters between single or double quotes.\n","\n","▶ Lists and string are different in following ways:\n","\n","1.Lists are mutable sequences while strings are immutable.\n","\n","2.Strings store single type of elements all characters while lists can store elements belongings to different type.\n","\n","3.In consecutive locations strings store the individual characters while list stores the references of its elements.\n","\n","7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Tuples in python ensure data integrity through thier immutability. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added or removed. This characteristic gurantees that the data stored within a tuple remains constant throughout its lifecycle. Immutability makes tuples suitable for scenarios where data integrity is paramount, such as representing fixed records, storing configuration settings, or using them as keys in dictionaries. Any attempt to modify a tuple will result in an error, preventing accidental or unintended data corruption.\n","\n","8. What is a hash table and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, where each key is unique and mapped to a specific location (index) in an array using a hash function. This allows for efficient retrieval,insertion and deletion of data.\n","\n"," ▶Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. when a key-value pair is added to a dictionary, python calculates the hash value of the key and users it to determine the index where the value will be stored. When retrieving a value, python calculates the hash value of the key again and uses it to quickly locate the value in the hash table.\n","\n"," ▶ Hash tables provide average-case o(1) time complexity for search, insert and delete operations, making them a hghly efficient data structure for implementing dictinaries. However, in the worst-case scenario(e.g many keys hashing to the same index), these operations can take O(n) time, where n is the number of key-value pairs. to mitigate this, python's dictionary implementation includes collision resolution mechanisms to handle mutltiple keys mapping keys mapping to same index.\n","\n","9. Can lists contain different data types in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Yes, lists in python can contain elements of different data types. A single list can hold a mix of integers, floats, strings, booleans and even othe lists, tuples or dictinaries. This flexibility is a key feauture of python lists.\n","\n","10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n","\n"," ▶ In python, strings are immutable because of several key benefits related to efficiency, safety and simplicity.\n","\n","* Efficiency:- Immutabilty allows python to optimize memory usage. when multiple string variables have the same value, they can reference the same memory location. If strings were mutable, each variable would need its own copy, wasting memory.\n","\n","* Safety:- Immutability prevents unintended modifications. If a function receives a string as input, it can be sure that the original string will not be altered, avoiding unexpected side effects.This is crucial in multithread environments where data consistency is paramount\n","\n","* Hashing:-Immutable objects, like strings, can be used as keys in dictinaries and elements ins sets. Mutable objects cannot be hashed because their values can change, which would violate the integrity of these data structures.\n","\n","* Simplicity:- Immutability makes string manipulation more predictable. When a string is modified, a new string object is created, leaving the original string unchanged. This simplifies debugging and reasoning about code.\n","\n","11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks ?\n","\n"," ▶ This can give more flexibility when storing data. The primary advantage would be retrieving stored values as it is much simpler to search through a dictionary. If the data your trying to store is identifiable so the data can be attributed to name or item this might be a prefarable system.\n","\n","12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n","\n"," ▶ Tuples are immutable. Hence, they are primarily used to store data that doesn't want it to change. Tuples are great to use if you want the data in your collection to be read-only, never to change and always remain the same and constant.\n","\n","13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ In python, sets are design to store only unique elements. When an attempt is made to add a duplicate value to a set, it is automatically discarded, ensuring that set contains no repeated elements. This behaviour is fundamental to the nature of sets as unordered collections of distinct items.\n","\n","14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries ?\n","\n"," ▶ The 'in' operation for the dictionary tests on keys. The key of the dictionary is a unique value as well as the set and the execution time is about the same as for sets. On the other hand, dictionary values can be duplicated like a list.\n","\n","15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not ?\n","\n"," ▶ No, you cannot directly modify the elements of a tuple in python after it's been created. Tuples are immutable, meaning thier contents cannot be changed once they are defined. Trying to modify a tuple will result in a TypeError.\n","\n","16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case ?\n","\n"," ▶ A nested dictionary in python is a dictionary where the values are themselves dictionaries. This allows for the creation of a hierarchical structure where data can be organized into multiple levels. A common use case for nested dictionaries is representing complex, multi layered data, such as employee information with nested address and contact details.\n","\n","\n","   Here's an example:\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"qJ5n-Fjii9Mk"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["employee ={\n","    \"name\": \"Alice Smith\",\n","    \"job_title\": \"Software Engineer\",\n","    \"address\":{\n","        \"street\": \"123 main st\",\n","        \"city\": \"Anytown\",\n","        \"state\": \"CA\",\n","        \"zip\":\"91234\"\n","    },\n","    \"contact\": {\n","        \"phone\": \"555-123-4657\",\n","        \"email\": \"alice.smith@example.com\"\n","    }\n","}\n"],"metadata":{"id":"73UPbnV9cQ36","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747261223560,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":42,"user":{"displayName":"Shubham Yadav","userId":"17612701105650508696"}}},"execution_count":43,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In this example, employee dictionary contains nested dictionaries for address and contact. This allows for easy oganization and access of detailed information related to the employee's address and contact details.\n","\n","17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary ?\n","\n"," ▶ Accessing an elements in a dictionary using its key typically has a time complexity of O(1) on average, meaning it takes constant time, reagardless of the dictionary's size. However, in worst case scenario, it can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of key-value pairs, if there are many hash collisions.\n","\n","18.  In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries ?\n","\n"," ▶ Lists are faster for index-based access, as retrieving an element by index takes O(1), whereas dictionary lookups require computing a hash. Dictionaries requires more memory, as they store keys along with value unlike lists.\n","\n","19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered and how does that affect data retrieval ?\n","\n"," ▶ Dictionary is a data structure  which is a important value structure, optimized for fast storage and recovery based on key. In python, dictionaries are unordered because python dictionaries are not intendend to be in order.Basically that contains key:value pairs seprated by commas inside curly brackets. Dictionary are optimized to retrieve values when the key is known.\n","\n","20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","\n"," ▶ In terms of data retrieval, a dictionary excels at quickly accessing values using unique keys, while a list retrieves values based on thier position (index) in a sequence. Lists require searching through elements, while dictionaries use hashing for near-instaneous lookup, making them significantly faster for accessing data by a specific identifier.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"6_hYEPCwd_cB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["  Practical questions:\n","\n","1.
